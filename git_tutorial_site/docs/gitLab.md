# GitHub vs. GitLab:

Web platforms that host **remote Git repositories** + add powerful collaboration tools.

---

#### **GitHub**

- **Focus:** **Social coding** and open source. The world's largest code host.
- **Key Feature:** **Pull Requests** are the core of its collaboration model.
- **Community:** Massive public community. The default portfolio for developers.
- **vibe:** "The social network for code."

#### **GitLab**

- **Focus:** **DevOps lifecycle** and enterprise features. "Single application for entire DevOps lifecycle."
- **Key Feature:** Built-in **CI/CD** (automated testing/deployment) is free and integrated.
- **Deployment:** Offers both cloud (SaaS) and self-hosted options (install on your own server).
- **vibe:** "The all-in-one DevOps platform."

#### **The Core Similarity**

Both provide the essential Git hosting services:

- `git push`, `git pull`, `git clone`
- Code browsing
- Issue tracking
- Code review

**In short:**

- Use **GitHub** for its massive community and as your coding portfolio.
- Use **GitLab** for its powerful, integrated DevOps and CI/CD tools, especially if you need self-hosting.
